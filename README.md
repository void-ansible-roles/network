# Ansible Collection - void.network

The network collection includes various roles that are helpful for
setting up network configurations on Void Linux.  The various
components include DNS and name related configurations, static and
dynamic addressing, and components related to the iptables firewall
handler that other roles depend on.

All the behavior that was previously provied by the standalone role is
now provided by the unmaintained role `void.network.legacy`.
